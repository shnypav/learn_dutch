## ideas:

- [x] add color theme configurator with the preview window

🌟 High Priority (8-10/10)

- [x] Spaced Repetition System (SRS) - 10/10
      Implement algorithm (SM-2/Anki-style) to schedule reviews based on performance. Cards appear when optimal for memory
      retention. Critical for long-term learning effectiveness.

- [ ] Audio Pronunciation - 9/10
      Add text-to-speech for Dutch words/verbs with native accent. Helps with speaking/listening skills - essential for
      language learning beyond written practice.

- [x] Multiple Choice Mode - 8/10
      Alternative practice format with 4 answer options. Lower barrier for beginners, faster practice sessions, good for
      mobile usage.

⭐ Medium Priority (6-7/10)

- [ ] Flashcard Deck Organization - 7/10
      Create custom study sets (themes: food, verbs, A2-level). Filter by difficulty/tags. Better content management for
      focused learning.

- [ ] Daily Goal System - 7/10
      Set/track daily targets (words reviewed, time spent, accuracy). Gamification element to boost consistency and
      motivation.

- [ ] Sentence Construction Practice - 7/10
      Build sentences using learned vocabulary. Bridge between isolated words and real usage. Natural progression from
      current features.

- [ ] Learning Reminders - 6/10
      Browser notifications for study sessions. Helps maintain streaks. Simple but effective engagement tool.

💡 Nice to Have (4-5/10)

- [ ] Export/Import Progress - 5/10
      Sync data across devices via JSON export. Useful for power users, backup capability, but low priority given local
      storage works well.

- [ ] Leaderboard/Social Features - 4/10
      Compare stats with friends. Adds competition but requires backend infrastructure - significant scope increase.

- [ ] Grammar Explanations - 5/10
      Contextual grammar tips for verb conjugations. Educational but requires content creation - may dilute focus on
      current strength (practice).

- [ ] Difficulty Adjustment - 6/10
      Auto-filter words based on CEFR level (A1/A2/B1). Adaptive learning path. Requires dataset enhancement with
      difficulty tags.

- [ ] Performance Charts - 5/10
      Graph accuracy/streak trends over time. Visual motivation but statistics dashboard already covers core analytics.

Top recommendation: Start with Spaced Repetition System - transforms the app from practice tool to comprehensive
learning system with proven retention science.
